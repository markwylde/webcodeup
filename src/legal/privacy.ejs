      details of the information we hold about you.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
      <p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page
      and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any
      updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>
